# 100-days-of-Python-Coding
This repository tracks my journey of coding in Python for 100 days. It contains small projects, exercises, and experiments that gradually increase in complexity. 
The goal of this project is to improve  my Python skills through daily practice and to document my progress. These projects range from simple exercises to more advanced programs, demonstrating my growth as a Python developer.
